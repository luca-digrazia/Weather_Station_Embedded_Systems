# Weather_Station_Embedded_Systems

This assignment consists of developing an embedded system to manage some data
coming from sensors of a Weather Station. It is equipped with an anemometer, a rain
sensor and a thermometer.I used some hardware devices and software tools:
     
• FRDM K64F     
• Micrium uC/OS-III     
• Kinetis Design Studio 3 IDE     
• Digilent Analog Discovery 2     
• Digilent waveform tool    
• Tera Term
